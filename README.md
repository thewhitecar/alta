## Alta Campaign

I created this repo to highlight some of my visual/creative chops.  I built these five banner placements for a marketing campaign for Alta Ski Resort.  I was hired through a creative agency to build these banners from very basic mock-ups with a twenty-four hour turnaround time.  Effective communication, an eye for detail, and quick problem solving were essential for succeeding on this project!  A few screenshots are posted below.  Thanks for taking a look!
